```{r}

```

## R Markdown

All of this info is just plain descriptive text! For the {} all you need is the type of code you're working with ('r') but you also can add a name to the code chunk and then refer back to it later, as seen below

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Hi folks nice to see you!
The chunk of code below adds 2 and 3 together
```{r echo = FALSE}
2 + 3
```


```{r eval = FALSE}
2 + 3
```


```{r}
2 + 3
```
